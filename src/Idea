smart order for 4 months

total_diff = 0

m2 - m1 = diff<2,1>
	diff<1,2> + total_diff

m3 - m2 = dif<3,2>
	diff<3,2> + total_diff

m4 - m3 = diff<4,3>
	diff<4,3> + total_diff


get std div 

Sale Constant "C" = std_div / total_diff

is this right 
	since if the total diff is neg (meaning we are selling less and less) then the C is neg
	otherwise pos.

Biggest problem
